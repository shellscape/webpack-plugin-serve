## üç≤ React App

In addition to individual recipes for feature implementation, it's often useful for folks at many levels of experience to see a framework wired up and functional with the plugin. This recipe combines a simple "Hello World" style [React](https://reactjs.org) application with [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin), [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) and `webpack-plugin-serve`. This project also has initial setup for fonts, images and css.

This recipe leverages [webpack-nano](https://github.com/shellscape/webpack-nano), a very tiny, very clean webpack CLI.

## Meta

This recipe was heavily inspired by https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/examples/webpack-modern and some modifications made based on experience and personal preference. The original is licensed under MIT.
