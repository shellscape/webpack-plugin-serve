## üç≤ Setting up Multiple entries

Certain applications or bundles may require several separate entries. Depending on a user's needs, it may be desirable to make Hot Module Replacement, live-reload, or any other client feature available for each entries, or specific entries other than the default. To accomplish that, the `webpack-plugin-serve/client` file must be included with entries on which client features are needed. We'll show you how that should look below.


### Meat and Potatoes

Let's say for this example that you have an application which bundles two pages and a web worker separately:

```js


module.exports = {
  entry: {
    landing: './landing.js',
    checkout: './checkout.js',
    worker: './worker.js'
  },
  // ...rest of your config
};
```

### Making the Meal

We'll now add the client script to the entries we'd like to have client-side features added to:

```js
const { WebpackPluginServe: Serve } = require('webpack-plugin-serve');

const serve = new Serve();

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    landing: ['./landing.js', 'webpack-plugin-serve/client'],
    checkout: './checkout.js',
    worker: ['./worker.js', 'webpack-plugin-serve/client']
  },
  // ...rest of your config
};
```

Note that we left the client script off of one of the entries. It's not required that _all entries_ have the client script - only those you wish to use the client-side features for.


### üç∞ Dessert

Go forth with a full belly and contentment, for you've enabled client-side goodies for your entries.
