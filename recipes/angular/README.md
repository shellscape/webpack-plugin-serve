## üç≤ AngularJS

In addition to individual recipes for feature implementation, it's often useful for folks at many levels of experience to see a framework wired up and functional with the plugin. This recipe combines a simple "Hello World" style [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) application with [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) and `webpack-plugin-serve`.

This recipe leverages [webpack-nano](https://github.com/shellscape/webpack-nano), a very tiny, very clean webpack CLI.
