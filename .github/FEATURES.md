## Standout Features

- Fully functional **Hot Module Replacement with MultiCompilers**. `webpack-plugin-serve` is the only development server for Webpack which applies HMR updates from multiple compilers/configurations to the page _without a page reload_.
- Host and Port can be set to a `Promise`, which allows for dynamic host and port resolution before the server starts.
- The client (browser) WebSocket host can be set, allowing full customization for contain environments.
- Fully customizable middleware, including execution order of built-in middleware. Users may implement whichever middleware they desire in the order which works best for them.
- Leverages the `open` module and all of it's available options, without restriction, for opening the target application in the browser automatically.
- A themed, UX-consistent Build Status (errors, warnings) overlay with minimized beacon mode for monitoring the status of builds during editing.
- A themed, UX-consistent set of Build Progress overlay+indicator, with minimal option.
- Superior serverless WebSocket connectivity.
